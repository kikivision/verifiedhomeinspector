Things decided but not built, and things built in a way that looks wrong
until you know why. Newest first.

## 2026-09-11 — When both featured spots fill, show a waitlist, not an empty slot

**Decided. Not built.** Build it when a second county sells its first
featured spot, or when either county fills both — whichever comes first.

### The question

The featured row holds two spots (`FEATURED_CAP`). While one is empty it
renders a "This spot could be yours" card with a **Get featured** button,
which is the only prominent place the featured product is sold. The
thought was to leave the second spot deliberately empty so inspectors
keep seeing that advertisement.

### The decision

**Do not hold a spot empty. Fill both, and replace the empty-slot card
with a taken state that still asks.**

> **Both featured spots in Pinellas are taken.**
> 316 licensed inspectors are listed here. Only 2 sit above all of them.
> **Join the waitlist**

Same position, same button, same `featured_inquiry` event.

### Why

**Holding a spot empty costs $50/month to run an advertisement.** That is
paying for marketing with inventory.

**An empty slot is the weaker advertisement.** "This could be yours" beside
one taken spot reads as availability — come back later. Two taken spots
above all 316 listings read as necessity. Scarcity persuades once it is
demonstrated, not while it is merely claimed. It also contradicts the
claim panel's own line, that the first inspectors to take a spot keep
that rate for as long as they stay, which is urgency built on the spots
running out.

**The real loss when the row fills is capture, not advertising.**
`openFeaturedSlots` goes to zero, so no ad-slot card renders at all: the
Get featured button and its `featured_inquiry` event disappear from the
top of the page, and the only surviving pitch is one sentence in the
claim panel below 316 listings. An inspector who has finally decided has
no prominent way to say so. That button is not theoretical — a visitor
fired `featured_inquiry` from it on 2026-09-10, the site's second day.

**A waitlist is also the pricing instrument we do not have.** Four
inspectors waiting at $50/mo means the price is too low or the cap of 2
is too tight. The DB allows six positions (`featured_position` checks
1–6), so raising the cap is a one-line change — but today, when the row
fills, we learn nothing at all.

### Shape when built

A third state on the ad-slot card, reusing `#featuredDialog`, which
already exists and already logs `featured_inquiry`. The waitlist needs
somewhere to land — most cheaply the same Netlify form path the claim and
request forms use, rather than a new table.

### What would reverse this

An inspector saying the full row put them off asking. Nobody has said
that; nobody has been shown a full row yet.
